  Cricket commentators often talk of changes in batting quality through the ages. Or they say that batting order matters to averages (or vice-versa). But is there anything in these questions?
---

A couple of years ago, I downloaded the top 200 averages for each batting order from the wonderful stats engine at [espnCricinfo](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html), before:

-   Ignoring averages from players with fewer than twenty innings
-   Considering only results against Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies

For reference, here is a summary of the resulting data.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| code-fold: true

library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(glue)
library(magick)
  
batOrder <- read_csv("BattingOrder.csv") |>  
  mutate(
    Name = word(Player, start = 1L, end = -2L),
    fullCountry = word(Player, -1),
    Country = str_sub(fullCountry, 2,-2)) %>% 
  filter(
    Country %in% c("Aus", "Ban", "Eng", "India", "NZ", "Pak", "SA", "SL", "WI")
    ) |> 
  mutate(
    Start = as.integer(str_sub(Span, 1, 4)),
    Decade = 10*trunc(Start/10),
    Name = str_replace_all(Name, "'", " ") 
    ) |> 
  select(Name, Country, Start, Decade, Ave, Innings = Inns, Runs, Bat)

glimpse(batOrder, width = 70)
```

</br>

We can then analyse the data by batting order, using the splendid `gganimate`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

batOrder |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = Decade,
      y = Ave,
      color = Country, 
      size = Innings
      )
    ) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Last decade of the batsman's career",
    y = ""
    ) +
  ggtitle(
    'The best players who have ever batted at {closest_state} in the order',
    subtitle = 'Average when batting at that position'
    ) + 
  transition_states(
    states = Bat,
    transition_length = 2,
    state_length = 1
    ) + 
  ease_aes('cubic-in-out') 
```
