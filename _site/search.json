    "text": "The idea is pretty simple, which I’ll outline below. (I can do so, as the materials are already in the public domain.)\nIf you want the details, check out the formal paper at SSRN. For a more accessible introduction, I’d recommend the video below that was taken (and won an award) at the International Congress of Actuaries in 2014.\n\n\n\nThe gist of the idea\nIn short, a key mantra of investment advisors is that asset owners should ignore the performance of their asset manager. Whether the manager has outperformed for you or not, it is claimed, is irrelevant to how you should expect them to perform in the future. However, a key idea in statistics, called Bayesian thinking, suggests the opposite: that you should use any new information you get about something to update your thinking on it.\nIn this work, I therefore used Bayesian thinking to understand the advice that asset owners should get. It turns out that this advice makes common sense, particularly when paired with an understanding of whether the asset manager has some longer-term cyclicality in their performance.\nHere’s that video that I mentioned:"

    "text": "To do so, I’ll deliberately pick a minimal example and assume that our portfolio has the thirty-stock Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) as its index.\nI’ll show the results in a couple of paragraphs. Before that, let’s consider a little of the theory behind this analysis. Specifically, that the active variance of a portfolio relative to its index is: \\[\\omega^2 = X^T V X\\]\n, where:\n\nX is a vector of ‘excess weights’ for the thirty stocks (i.e. portfolio weight less index weight)\nV is a square matrix of the covariances between the returns of the thirty stocks\n\nGiven this equation, I see that I need to begin the analysis by downloading the holdings of the index and the pricing data for the constituent stocks.\n\nlibrary(reactable)\nlibrary(tidyquant)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tsibble)\nlibrary(waldo)\n\n# weights_index &lt;- tq_index(\"DOW\")\n# write_rds(x = weights_index, file = \"weights_index.rds\")\n\n# stock_prices  &lt;- tq_get(\n#   x = weights_index |&gt; pull(symbol), \n#   get = \"stock.prices\", \n#   from = \"2022-01-01\")\n# write_rds(x = stock_prices, file = \"stock_prices.rds\", compress = \"xz\")\n\n\n\nStock holdings\nWith this data, I can see that the DJIA has the following stocks. For the sake of simplicity, I assume that these thirty stocks are weighted equally in our portfolio.\n\ndata_weights &lt;- read_rds(\"weights_index.rds\") |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    wt_port = 1/30,\n    wt_excess = wt_port - weight) |&gt; \n  arrange(symbol)\n\ndata_weights |&gt; \n  select(company, symbol, `excess weight` = wt_excess)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn covariances\nBefore I can project the risk in this portfolio, though, I also need to find the covariances between the returns of the stocks in question.1\nFor the sake of brevity, here are the first four rows and columns of this covariance matrix.\n\nreturn_covariances &lt;- read_rds(file = \"stock_prices.rds\") |&gt;\n  as_tsibble(index = date, key = symbol) |&gt; \n  mutate(yyyymm = tsibble::yearmonth(date)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = date, by = yyyymm) |&gt; \n  as_tsibble(index = date, key = symbol) |&gt; \n  mutate(return = (adjusted/lag(adjusted)) - 1) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = date, names_from = symbol, values_from = return) |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(var = \"date\") |&gt; \n  cov(use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n\nas_tibble(return_covariances[1:4, 1:4])\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjecting risk\nWe now have the two ingredients that we need for risk analysis: excess weights and covariances of stock returns. As a final test, let’s confirm that the order of the tickers in our vector matches that for our matrix.\n\ncompare(\n  pull(data_weights, symbol), \n  colnames(return_covariances)\n  )\n\n✔ No differences\n\n\nWith that confirmed, I can use the formula above to project the active variance of the portfolio.\n\n(\n  variance_active_monthly &lt;- t(data_weights$wt_excess) %*% return_covariances %*% data_weights$wt_excess\n  )\n\n           [,1]\n[1,] 0.01163479\n\n\nBecause I am considering covariances with a monthly periodicity, it will help to annualise the result, so that it can be compared with corresponding values from other portfolios. To do so, I multiply the active variance by 12.2 Finally, I square-root the result to obtain \\(\\omega\\), the annualised level of projected active risk:\n\n(\n  risk_active_annual &lt;- as.numeric(\n    sqrt(variance_active_monthly * 12)\n    )\n  )\n\n[1] 0.3736543\n\n\nThis annualised ‘tracking-error’ of 37.4% is very high for a US equity portfolio, but is not surprising given my arbitrary choices around the portfolio and index.\n\n\n\nDecomposing risk\nThe question then becomes: “What portfolio positions contribute most to this active risk?”\nTo answer this question, we can tweak the equation above. Calculating \\(X^T V\\) generates a vector of length thirty, with each element showing a form of ‘unit marginal impact’ on active portfolio variance for a given stock. If we then multiply this value for a given stock by its excess weight, we obtain its contribution to monthly active portfolio variance.3\n\nvariance_active_monthly_cont &lt;- return_covariances %*% data_weights$wt_excess |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  rownames_to_column(var = \"symbol\") |&gt; \n  inner_join(data_weights, by = \"symbol\") |&gt; \n  mutate(AV_cont = wt_excess * V1) |&gt; \n  select(symbol, company, sector, wt_excess, AV_cont)\n\nvariance_active_monthly_cont |&gt; \n  select(symbol, sector, `AV contribution` = AV_cont)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nTo decompose this active variance by sector, we group stocks by sector and sum their stock-level contributions.\n\nvariance_active_monthly_cont |&gt; \n  summarise(AV_total = sum(AV_cont), .by = sector) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    sector = as_factor(sector),\n    sector = fct_reorder(sector, AV_total)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = AV_total,\n      y = sector,\n      fill = AV_total &lt; 0)) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Contribution to active variance by sector\\n\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL) +\n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nSo, what does this analysis tell us? To me, there are two main points:\n\nThe portfolio’s tracking error is very high, although that is an artefact of the simplified nature of my example\nFinancials stocks are a key contributor to this active variance. This sector has high weights in the index but lower weights in the portfolio. However, the portfolio’s positions in Energy and Consumer Staples stocks generates a diversification benefit that reduces overall portfolio risk.\n\nAlthough these results might be useful, it is worth recognising that I have limited this risk analysis to only a standard covariance matrix, decomposed by sector. In reality, the returns data and covariance matrix could be more nuanced and decomposition could extend beyond sectors. For example, we could decompose risk by ESG scores, diversity criteria, valuation ratios or anything else that seems relevant and that can be measured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, I only consider split-adjusted price returns rather than the equivalent total returns in this example↩︎\nThis might be a heroic assumption, as it implies an independence between the risks experienced in different months↩︎\nNote that the sum of these values will add to the total active variance, as this calculation is essentially vector multiplication.↩︎"

Generate ggplot2 charts in the style that I use\nOver time, I have coalesced towards the following small chunk of code that builds (what I consider to be) a decent-looking chart in ggplot2.\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = bill_length_mm,\n      y = body_mass_g\n      )\n    ) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\", \n    se = FALSE, \n    colour = \"#63431c\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Penguins with longer bills tend to be heavier\\n\",\n    subtitle = \"Body mass (g)\",\n    x = \"\\nBill length (mm)\",\n    y = NULL\n    ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, colour = \"#63431c\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 1)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Format tables in my preferred way\nI occasionally print tables using the out-of-the-box settings (admittedly tweaked by using the df-print: paged option in part 1 above). This generates a table as follows.\n\npenguins\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOtherwise, I usually use reactable with the following tweaks.\n\nlibrary(reactable)\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, body_mass_g) |&gt; \n  reactable(\n    filterable = TRUE, \n    highlight = TRUE, \n    borderless = TRUE, \n    defaultPageSize = 5, \n    columns = list(\n      species = colDef(name = \"Species\", minWidth = 90, sticky = \"left\"),\n      island = colDef(name = \"Island\", minWidth = 90, sticky = \"left\"),\n      bill_length_mm = colDef(name = \"Bill length\", sticky = \"right\", filterable = FALSE, format = colFormat(separators = TRUE, digits = 1)),\n      bill_depth_mm = colDef(name = \"Bill depth\", sticky = \"right\", filterable = FALSE, format = colFormat(separators = TRUE, digits = 1)),\n      body_mass_g = colDef(name = \"Body mass\", sticky = \"right\", filterable = FALSE, format = colFormat(separators = TRUE, digits = 0))\n      )\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nFor completeness, I occasionally also use DT (i.e. the datatable package).\nlibrary(DT)\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(\"Species\" = species, \"Island\" = island, \"Bill length\" = bill_length_mm, \"Bill depth\" = bill_depth_mm, \"Body mass\" = body_mass_g) |&gt; \n  datatable(\n    rownames = FALSE, \n    width = \"100%\",\n    options=list(\n      dom = 'tip',\n      pageLength = 5\n      )\n    ) |&gt; \n  formatRound(\n    columns = 3:4,\n    digits = 1\n    ) |&gt; \n  formatRound(\n    columns = 5,\n    digits = 0\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Access databases inside and outside of shiny\nI use the wonderful DBI and dbplyr all the time, not least for exploratory analysis.\n(Note that whilst I typically don’t use SQLite, I will do so here, as it plays better with my website architecture.)\n\nlibrary(RSQLite)\n\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \":memory:\")\n\ndbWriteTable(con, \"instruments\", dplyr::band_instruments)\ndbWriteTable(con, \"members\", dplyr::band_members)\n\ndbListTables(con)\n\n[1] \"instruments\" \"members\"    \n\n\nIn this example, we create an object (con) for connecting to the SQLite database, where we add two tiny tables, called instruments and members. We can then explore these tables.\n\ntbl(src = con, \"instruments\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\ntbl(src = con, \"members\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nEven better, we can explore the tables when they are combined and tidied. (Whilst the code appears to return all the data, that’s only because our tables are uncommonly small.)\n\ntbl(src = con, \"instruments\") |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    tbl(src = con, \"members\"), \n    by = \"name\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(band == \"Beatles\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOnce you have what you need, assign a name to the code and append it with |&gt; collect().\n\nWhilst this functionality is great outside of shiny, it is often more valuable within it. (After all, these apps can be a really safe and simple way for users to access a corporate database.)\nTo do so, some other tweaks are required within shiny’s server functionality, as illustrated below.\n\ndata_chosen &lt;- shiny::reactive({\n  shiny::req(input$dataset)\n  main_data |&gt; \n    dplyr::filter(name_dataset == input$dataset) |&gt; \n    dplyr::mutate(id = as.integer(id))\n  })\n\ndata_chosen_id &lt;- shiny::reactive(\n  quote({data_chosen()$id}),\n  quoted = TRUE\n  )\n\ndata_calculated &lt;- shiny::reactive({\n  arbitrary_function(\n    con,\n    arbitrary_argument = data_chosen_id()\n    )\n  })\n\n\n\n\n5. Solve common niggles in package building\nWhen I’m building packages, I often get dinged with notes or warnings about two common package niggles.\nThe first of these is non-ASCII characters. With apologies for the person who showed me, and who I now can’t recall, you can find these characters by:\n\nClicking CTRL + F in RStudio\nSelecting the Regex tick-box\nEntering: [\\u0080-\\uFFFF] or [^\\x00-\\x7F] as the search term\n\nFrom there, you can use stringi::stri_escape_unicode('@') to get the Unicode equivalent for @. (Note that you also might need to remove the initial ‘\\’ on Windows.)\n\nThe second niggle of package building concerns variable binding. It occurs during the package check and creates a note along the following lines.\nno visible binding for global variable\n    ‘ABC’\nIn this case, we need to do something of the form below (from my simple package p0bservations that you can find here).\n\n#' @title Calculate income net of UK tax and National Insurance\n#'\n#' @description This function ...\n#' @param income_taxable The taxable income level ...\n#' @param tax_year_end The calendar year in which the tax year ends ...\n#' @export\n#' @examples\n#' \\dontrun{\n#' calc_income_net(income_taxable = 38000, tax_year_end = 2022L)\n#' }\n#' \n#' @importFrom rlang .data\n\nOnce we have added the line of #' @importFrom rlang .data, we can call the variables as follows (i.e. as before, but preceded by .data$).\n\nyear_tax_end_options &lt;- p0bservations::tax_parameters |&gt; \n  dplyr::distinct(.data$year_tax_end) |&gt; \n  dplyr::pull(.data$year_tax_end)\n\n\nOnce again, I hope that this aide-mémoire helps you as well as me!"

Specifically, the wonderful data from the espnCricinfo stats engine.\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nscrape_stats &lt;- function(value_count){\n  value_url &lt;- paste0(\n    \"https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?batting_positionmax1=\",\n    value_count,\n    \";batting_positionmin1=\",\n    value_count,\n    \";batting_positionval1=batting_position;class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;opposition=2;opposition=3;opposition=4;opposition=5;opposition=6;opposition=7;opposition=8;orderby=runs;qualmin1=20;qualval1=innings;size=200;template=results;type=batting\"\n    )\n  \n  read_html(value_url) |&gt; \n    rvest::html_table() |&gt; \n    _[[3]]\n}\n\ndata_scraped &lt;- map(\n  .x = 1:11, \n  .f = ~scrape_stats(value_count = .x)\n  ) |&gt; \n  list_rbind(names_to = \"order_batting\")\n\nwrite_rds(x = data_scraped, file = \"data_scraped.rds\")\n\nThat said, I only consider:\n\nPlayers with twenty innings or more\nScores for and against the ‘top sides’ (i.e. Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies) at some point\n\nAfter a little more tidying, we get the following data on about 1,000 batsmen. (In the resulting table, you can type into the text boxes below a column heading to filter the column by those values or click a column heading to order the table accordingly.)\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(magick)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\ndata_batsmen &lt;- read_rds(\"data_scraped.rds\") |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Name = word(Player, start = 1L, end = -2L),\n    fullCountry = word(Player, -1),\n    Country = str_sub(fullCountry, 2,-2),\n    Start = as.integer(str_sub(Span, 1, 4)),\n    Decade = 10*trunc(Start/10),\n    Name = str_replace_all(Name, \"'\", \" \") \n    ) |&gt; \n  filter(!(Country %in% c(\"BAN\", \"ZIM\"))) |&gt; \n  select(Name, Country, Decade, \"Average\" = Ave, \"Innings\" = Inns, \"Order\" = order_batting) |&gt; \n  arrange(Order, desc(Average))\n\ndata_batsmen |&gt; \n  reactable(\n    filterable = TRUE, \n    highlight = TRUE, \n    borderless = TRUE, \n    defaultPageSize = 10, \n    columns = list(\n      Name = colDef(minWidth = 200, filterable = TRUE, sticky = \"left\"),\n      Country = colDef(filterable = TRUE, sticky = \"left\"),\n      Decade = colDef(filterable = TRUE, sticky = \"right\"),\n      Average = colDef(filterable = FALSE, sticky = \"right\", format = colFormat(separators = TRUE, digits = 2)),\n      Innings = colDef(filterable = FALSE, sticky = \"right\", format = colFormat(separators = TRUE, digits = 0)),\n      Order = colDef(filterable = TRUE, sticky = \"right\", format = colFormat(separators = TRUE, digits = 0))\n      )\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then analyse the data by batting order, using the splendid gganimate.\n\ndata_batsmen |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = Decade,\n      y = Average,\n      color = Country, \n      size = Innings\n      )\n    ) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"First decade of the batsman's career\",\n    y = \"\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\n    'Players who have ever batted at {closest_state} in the order',\n    subtitle = 'Average when batting at that position'\n    ) + \n  transition_states(\n    states = Order,\n    transition_length = 2,\n    state_length = 1\n    ) + \n  ease_aes('cubic-in-out') \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough that looks cool, I find it hard to detect patterns in animations, and so switch to a static plot.\n\ndata_batsmen |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = Order,\n      y = Average,\n      colour = Decade\n      )\n    ) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11), breaks = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = c(0, 50, 100), breaks = c(0, 50, 100)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Decade) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Data is limited before the 1950s\\n',\n    subtitle = 'Batting average, when batting at that position, for a career that started in the given decade',\n    x = \"\\nBatting order\",\n    y = NULL\n    ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the paucity of data before the 1950s and in this decade, it makes sense to drop these decades from our analysis.

Furthermore, the lines with higher typical top-order averages all seem to be darker (and therefore earlier).\nTo get more specific, let’s split this top-order data into two eras: the 1950s to the 1970s; and the 1980s and beyond. I can then compare the typical top-order batting averages in these eras.\n\ndata_test &lt;- data_batsmen |&gt; \n  filter(\n    between(Decade, 1950, 2010),\n    Order &lt;= 5\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(is_1950s_to_1970s = Decade &lt;= 1970) |&gt; \n  select(Average, is_1950s_to_1970s) \n\nt.test(\n  data = data_test, \n  Average ~ is_1950s_to_1970s, \n  alternative = \"less\"\n  )\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  Average by is_1950s_to_1970s\nt = -2.0788, df = 348.5, p-value = 0.01918\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group FALSE and group TRUE is less than 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n       -Inf -0.4100609\nsample estimates:\nmean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE \n           39.55741            41.54190 \n\n\n\nOK, so that’s a lot of detail! But what does it show?\nEssentially, it says that the reduction in typical top-order batting averages since the 1950s to 1980s is statistically significant. (That is, beyond what we would usually expect from chance alone.)\nOf course, this reduction might not be solely due to lower inherent skill levels relative to the prevailing bowlers. Two possible reasons are that:\n\nThe game is now different to before, with DRS, helmets and masses of analysis\nSurvivor bias might be a factor. After all, we are only considering players with twenty or more innings, for and against the ‘top sides’; a point also complicated by the fact that there are now more test matches per year than in the past\n\nAs is often the way with cricket, so much is in the interpretation and debate. And that’s just another reason to love it!\n\n\n\n[Updated on March 25, 2023]"
