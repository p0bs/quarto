After a good run of thirteen years, now feels like the right time to end our PremPredict competition.

Thanks to all of you who have shared in the fun over this time. I'm pleased to say that this included Les Penfold, Mike Finnis and Roger Gathercole.

As you'll see below, though, this post and the Wall of Fame will remain here, always showing that Peter Finnis was left holding the crown!

(Oh yeah -- and always showing how some of the biggest football nerds remained winless.)
